# Workshop

## Can we trust the literature?

There are 2 options:

1) We study effects with more than 90% power, and more than 90% probability of being true.
2) There is MASSIVE publication bias.

### Threats to scientific replicability

#### 🧪 1. P-hacking

* Involves manipulating data analysis (e.g. trying different statistical models, selectively removing outliers, or stopping data collection when p < .05) to obtain significant results.
* Leads to inflated Type I error rates and unreliable findings.

#### 💡 2. HARKing

* Formulating hypotheses after seeing the data, and presenting them as a priori.
* Misleads readers and reviewers about the nature of the test and inflates the risk of false positives.

#### 📦 3. Publication Bias

* Journals are more likely to publish positive or novel results than null findings.
* "file drawer problem" creates a biased literature, overestimating effects and underreporting failed replications.

#### 📏 4. Low Statistical Power

* Many studies are underpowered (small sample sizes), increasing the risk of:
  * False negatives (Type II errors)
  * Inflated effect sizes when effects are detected

#### 🔧 5. Flexible Data Analysis Pipelines

* Also known as "researcher degrees of freedom":
  * Multiple ways to preprocess data
  * Different outcome variables
  * Optional covariates
* If not preregistered, these decisions can bias outcomes.

#### 🧠 6. Lack of Preregistration

* Without preregistration, it is difficult to distinguish exploratory from confirmatory analyses.
* Encourages the garden of forking paths (many possible analyses), increasing false positives.

#### 🧾 7. Inadequate Reporting

* Omission of crucial details (e.g. exact methods, software versions, data preprocessing steps) makes replication difficult or impossible.
* Hinders transparency and reproducibility.

#### 📊 8. Selective Outcome Reporting

* Only reporting certain measures or time points based on results.
* Undermines the integrity of confirmatory research.

#### 🔄 9. Failure to Share Data and Code

* Without open access to data and analysis code, replication becomes time-consuming or unfeasible.
* Limits the ability of others to check for errors or reproduce results.

#### 🌐 10. Cultural and Incentive Structures

* “Publish or perish” culture rewards flashy, positive, and novel findings.
* Little reward (until recently) for replication studies or null results.

### Preregistration workshop

XXXXXX

### Limitations and Considerations

* Pre-registration is not a cure-all; its effectiveness depends on the completeness and specificity of the registered plans. Vague pre-registrations can reintroduce flexibility and bias [12](https://consensus.app/papers/not-all-preregistrations-are-equal-allen-waldron/4deb08f4a04153f180f6dc51064b4bc7/),[10](https://consensus.app/papers/a-systematic-review-of-preregistration-in-autism-research-allchin-linden/5df151aa26fc58c7804430c3d9acbbe6/).
* Some concerns exist about bureaucracy, restriction of exploratory analysis, and potential misuse (e.g., pre-registering after results are known) [4](https://consensus.app/papers/an-evaluation-of-the-effectiveness-of-study-dickson-bochantin/ef44d444dfe45026818f66312fa423a4/),[7](https://consensus.app/papers/campbell-%E2%80%99-s-law-explains-the-replication-crisis-klonsky/2714cea7c1205e86b057e5ee47678208/),[12](https://consensus.app/papers/not-all-preregistrations-are-equal-allen-waldron/4deb08f4a04153f180f6dc51064b4bc7/).
* Not all research types benefit equally, but most empirical studies can gain from some form of pre-registration [6](https://consensus.app/papers/harnessing-the-benefits-of-preregistration-for-dezutter-schellekens/80125a4ca0505ed8a8e1ce4b6cedb794/),[3](https://consensus.app/papers/preregistration-of-mathematical-models-ioannidis/0f1c2c7b812851f39217fa93bec4aba9/),[12](https://consensus.app/papers/not-all-preregistrations-are-equal-allen-waldron/4deb08f4a04153f180f6dc51064b4bc7/).
