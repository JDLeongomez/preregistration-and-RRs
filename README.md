# From Theory to Practice: Strengthening Research Integrity with Preregistration and Registered Reports

Welcome to the repository for the **Open Science Workshop** focused on preregistration and registered reports. This workshop introduces key tools and practices that foster transparency, rigour, and credibility in scientific research.

## 🌐 Overview

This workshop explores:
- The challenges facing scientific replicability
- The role of preregistration in clarifying hypotheses and analysis plans
- How registered reports transform peer review into a tool for improving study design
- Practical steps and tools for implementing these practices

> **Why it matters:**  
> Many scientific findings fail to replicate due to questionable research practices and structural biases in publication. Preregistration and registered reports offer scalable solutions to improve research quality and reduce stress for researchers.
